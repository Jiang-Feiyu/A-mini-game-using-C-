**Introduction of our game**
This is a game with a 5 * 5 board, Player 1 and Player 2 are generated diagonally, with @ and # representing Player 1 and Player 2, respectively.The goal is to get to the other person's starting point before the other person gets to your starting poits. The first to reach the other team's starting point wins. The **X** on the board is the portal, which can be teleported between (but you can't use it when either of the door is occupied by your opponents). You can choose to move one or two units at a time.*is the wall that you cannot pass and you can only move in the range of map."
	

**Features to implement**
1. Using random variables to initialize the array and save changes the player make .
2. Judging whether the playerâ€™s assigned point is 0/*/X, and make the default reaction.
3. Shows the turn and the result when the game is over.

**Match code requirement**
1-Random generation: Using random to assign the walls and the doors. 
2-Data structures: Using arrays to restore the possible location of the doors; using vectors to restore the whole map. 
3-Dynamic memory: Using vectors to restore the map.
4-File input/output: Allow users to save the result of the current game and loading the previous one when start the game. 
5-Multiple files: Main body, start menu. Explanation of the regulations.
